# Psychic-Game
We were to create a computer game app that will run in browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by our JavaScript code.
The app randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose.

"Guess what letter I'm thinking of" is the question asked.

Wins: (# of times the user has generated the letter correctly)

Losses: (# of times the user has falled to guess the letter correctly after exhausing all guesses)

Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update).

Your Guesses So Far: (the specfic letters taht the user typed. Displayed these until the user either wins or loses.)

When the player Wins, the Winsa counter increase and the game starts over without refreshing the page).

When the player loses, The counter increases the Losses and restarts the game without a page refresher(just like when the user wins).
